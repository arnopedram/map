		<div id="maptext"> Mapping New York's domestic violence complaints from 2017 to 2019 shows North Brooklyn, South Queens, North Manhattan and the Bronx to be the most affected by domestic violence. Patricia Ross has been working at the North Brooklyn Coalition Against Family Violence for the past 5 years, and is its current executive director. "We're cautiously hopeful that it's not that the number of domestic violence is going up but that victims know their rights and are calling for support."<br>
		<br>
		Reliance on police statistics might nevertheless be underestimating the problem. "We're an agency that works with majority Latina women who are immigrants and who don't necessarily want to get involved with police," Ross said, adding that the same issue comes up with the black women they work with. "They're afraid and they don't want to get their abuser in trouble." <br>
		<br>
		The prospect of option to the police is even more complicated for women with undocumented partners. "They're concerned that if they file a domestic violence report [their partner] will get deported," Ross said.
